# ash Master Repository
ash is an app (designed for iPhone) which allows users to rate, review, and sort their music. By doing so, you can connect with friends, keep a diary of your favorite songs, and even streamline the creation of playlists. This app is also intended to rethink the way smaller artists can release their music and expand their artists.
